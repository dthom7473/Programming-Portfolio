# Overview

As an aspiring Computer Engineer, my goal is to allow the convinience of modern technolagy to be accessed by all in the most familiar, user friendly way. I have in the past made many quality of life programs that make everyday activities such as an online order, a youtube comment section, or a fitness calculator, even easier to use for the average person. To further my learning, I aspire to familiarize myself with even more technological abilities in order to be able to understand how to further improve on my programs as well as future applications I would like to attempt to make.

My "Hello World" software is a short python program that prints the phrase, as well as stores a few simple questions using a function that the user can input and save in order to store information from the user that may be used for a future program that might require a few base questions. The program is simple and fast, and written in the ever intuitive python language.

The reason for creating this program was to set down some ground work for other potential additions for this portfolio. It's a simple but effective way to demonstrate a few of my programming capabilities.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

This program was made entirely by myself, but I did use stack overflow for a quick reminder about the python function syntax. Having coded a lot in C# recently, I used this site as a good way to jog my memory.

I used python to create this program because of the simplicity and intuitition that it takes to code in python. Not only is it easy to use, but it's also very easy for an outsider to understand.
